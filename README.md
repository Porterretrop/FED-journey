# FED-journey
My journey to become a *F*ront *E*nd *D*eveloper.

Each section of knowledge required to become a FED is grouped into their respective folders. 
I follow the roadmap provided by [Developer Roadmap][1] for front-end developer (roughly). Occasionally the order by which I study will deviate from their idea, nonetheless the roadmap is a very prominent backbone.
